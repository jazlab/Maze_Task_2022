Each file contains serialized stimulus information in json format. 
The filename is its unqiue ID for each maze.
Each file has the following 5 elements: 
1) maze_width: always 20 grids for human experiment,
2) maze_height: always 20 grids for human experiment, 
3) prey_arm: coordinates of constituent grids along target path from a start point to a exit point (grid coordinates is [0,0] for left bottom, [19,19] for top right), 
4) maze_walls: list of maze walls. Each maze wall is coded by [[x_start,y_start],[x_end,y_end]], Coordinate for maze wall is like grid 0 is surrounded by wall 0 and wall 1 - so maze wall ranges from 0 to 20 for 20-grid maze. 
5) features: 
    - name: 'LayeredMaze', 
    - start_x: x coordinate of start poing of path (e.g., 19), 
    - num_turns: number of turns in path, 
    - path_length: total path length in unit of number of grids, 
    - id: maze id (same as file name)

To find details, all stimuli were generated by https://github.mit.edu/jazlab/MazeSetGo/tree/master/task/configs/presample_trials.py 
(together with layered_maze_lib)
